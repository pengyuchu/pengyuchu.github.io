The real-world environment of a tree-grown orchard is inherently complex, making it difficult for harvesting robots to navigate and perform tasks while avoiding obstacles such as branches and foliage, while also accurately identifying and interacting with the fruit.\nIn response to this challenge, we developed the panoptic-DeepLab architecture tailored specifically for orchard environments. This architecture enables us to not only identify the main obstacles but also pinpoint the target, which, in our case, is apples for our harvesting robot. Our system segments each scene (see Fig. 1) into five distinct categories: apple, branch, foliage, sky, and ground. This dataset encompasses a wide range of orchard scenes, fruit morphologies, and various environmental conditions, thereby providing a comprehensive representation of real-world fruit detection scenarios.\nFigure 1. Orchard segmentation results. Given that branches pose the most significant obstacle, we have further developed skeleton-lead CNNs. This network works to skeletonize the branches (see Fig. 2), effectively transforming them into graph structures, resulting in improved branch segmentation accuracy. As a by-product, the branch graphs can also be leveraged to efficiently construct a 3D representation (see Fig. 3) of the scene using corresponding depth images. This wealth of data serves as crucial input for robotics planning and decision-making processes.\nFigure 2. Branch graphs outputed by skeleton-lead CNNs.

These limitations have been identified as the primary culprits behind the inaccuracies in apple localization, a problem that was evident in our previous field tests. In light of these issues, we have developed an Active Laser-Camera Scanning Scheme (ALACS), illustrated in Fig. 1, with the aim of improving the precision of apple localization.\nFigure 1. ALACS device. ALACS employs the triangulation technique (see Fig. 2) to determine 3D positions. We have opted for a laser line as our 2D pattern because of its superior stability and robustness. Thanks to the laser scanning mechanism, we can obtain multiple pattern candidates (see Fig. 3) along with their respective positions, thereby mitigating the risk of inaccuracies, such as occlusions.\nFigure 2.
