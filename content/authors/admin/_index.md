I am a Ph.D. candidate advised by [Dr. Zhaojian Li](https://www.egr.msu.edu/rival/) in the [RIVAL](https://www.egr.msu.edu/rival/research.html) group at Michigan State University. My primary focus is to develop adaptive perception algorithms for robotics. Based on this goal, my research resolves around image segmentation and vision-based localization in orchard-grown fruit harvesting, visual reasoning as well as reinforcement learning.  I am being expected to graduate in Dec, 2023. Previously, I obtained my M.S. in Computer Science at Michigan State University and B.S. in Computer Science at Sichuan University.
